I am a postdoctoral researcher in Physical Oceanography currently working at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel. 

My main interests are:

* Tropical Atlantic Variability (TAV)
  * Atlantic Niños
  * Benguela Niños
  
* Future projections of the TAV
  *  CMIP5 and CMIP6
  *  Uncertainty on the projections

* [Monitoring extreme events](https://aprig.github.io/ATL3_ABA_SSTa/automatic_time_series_SST.html)
