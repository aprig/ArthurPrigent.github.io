## What are Benguela Niños? 
Every few years the southeastern tropical Atlantic ocean is marked by large sea surface temperature (SST) deviations from its seasonal cycle. These deviations are named Benguela Niños, which are extreme and accute events occuring in the Angola-Benguela-Area (ABA, 8˚E-20˚E; 20˚S-10˚S, blue box) off the coasts of Angola and Namibia. A Benguela <span style="color:red">**Niño**</span> (<span style="color:blue">**Niña**</span>) is an extreme <span style="color:red"> **warm** </span> (<span style="color:blue">**cold**</span>) event, characterized by <span style="color:red">**warmer**</span> (<span style="color:blue">**colder**</span>) sea surface temperature than normal.

Typically, Benguela Niños/Niñas occur in March-April-May (MAM) as shown by the seasonal cycle of the standard deviation of the ABA-averaged SST anomalies (Figure 2). The peak of variability occur at the end of the warm season (February-March-April). There is a secondary peak of SST variability in November-December, just after the cold season of July-August-September.
